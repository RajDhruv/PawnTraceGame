1) Open console/terminal and move to the location where pawn_trace directory is located on the system and open the directory in terminal.
2) Execute start_game.rb by typing ruby start_game.rb
3) Follow the instructions on screen like when asked to enter the numbers of blocks in row, if you enter 10 it will create a 10 * 10 matrix/board for you and then enter the initial coordinates where the pawn is to be situated on the board.
4) If the pawn is able to traverse along the matrix then the path taken would be displayed as output else it will give an Error message for no Valid Path Found.

If you seperately want to execute the code then move to lib folder and at the end of pawn_trace.rb file create an object of PawnTrace class and initialize the number of blocks expected in a row.
Now call the start_pawn method for the object and initialize the position of pawn on board.
Eg: if you want to create 10 * 10 board and want the pawn to start from 4th row 3rd column, write:
	obj=PawnTrace.new (10)
	obj.start_pawn(3,2)
This will display the board with path taken if the pawn is successful in completing its journey. Else if no path found it wont display any thing.
